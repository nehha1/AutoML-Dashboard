# Automate the ML lifecycle: data ingestion, model training, deployment, and monitoring and workflow integration

## Aim
-To focus on operational efficiency and end-to-end cater to both technical and non-technical users.
-Deliver a functional prototype showcasing scalability and real-world integration potential.

 **Auto-Recommendation of Pipelines:** Simplifies the process of selecting optimal ML workflows by leveraging past experiments and AutoML capabilities.
 
 **Explainable AI (XAI) Integration:** Enhances model transparency, making it easier for both technical and non-technical users to trust and understand model predictions.
 
 **Continuous Learning & Model Drift Detection:** Keeps models relevant and effective by automatically retraining them when performance degrades in production.
 
 **One-Click Deployment to Multiple Environments:** Streamlines the deployment process, offering flexibility to deploy on the cloud,or on-premise environments with minimal 
effort.
 **Custom Feature Store Integration:** Boosts productivity and consistency by allowing users to reuse engineered features across projects, reducing redundant computations.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
